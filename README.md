## Introduction

This project is a RESTful API service designed for teachers to manage their students.

This API enables teachers to:

- Register multiple students.
- Retrieve common students.
- Suspend a student.
- Retrieve eligible students to receive notifications.

> âœ… Authentication and authorization are assumed to be already handled.
